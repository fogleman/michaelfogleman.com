    <h3>Hello!</h3>

            <p class="lead">My name is Michael Fogleman. I live in Cary, NC with my wife and our two beautiful children. I am a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="http://transloc.com/">TransL&#x014D;c</a>, where I analyze huge data sets and develop software to help improve transit. I love programming and am usually busy with one of many <a href="{{ url_for('projects') }}">personal projects</a>. My favorite programming languages are Python, C and Objective-C, though I also have significant <a href="{{ url_for('resume') }}">experience</a> with several other languages and technologies. I like gardening, photography, '80s music, space exploration and all kinds of food.</p>
